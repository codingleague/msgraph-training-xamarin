## Prerequisites

Before you start this tutorial, you should have [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) installed on a computer running Windows 10 with [Developer mode turned on](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development). If you do not have Visual Studio, visit the previous link for download options.

You should also have Xamarin installed as part of your Visual Studio installation. See [Installing Xamarin](/xamarin/cross-platform/get-started/installation) for instructions on installing and configuring Xamarin.

Optionally you should also have access to a Mac with Visual Studio for Mac installed. If you do not have access, you can still complete this tutorial, but will be unable to complete the iOS-specific sections.

You should also have either a personal Microsoft account with a mailbox on Outlook.com, or a Microsoft work or school account. If you don't have a Microsoft account, there are a couple of options to get a free account:

- You can [sign up for a new personal Microsoft account](https://signup.live.com/signup?wa=wsignin1.0&rpsnv=12&ct=1454618383&rver=6.4.6456.0&wp=MBI_SSL_SHARED&wreply=https://mail.live.com/default.aspx&id=64855&cbcxt=mai&bk=1454618383&uiflavor=web&uaid=b213a65b4fdc484382b6622b3ecaa547&mkt=E-US&lc=1033&lic=1).
